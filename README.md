Fig. S1: Generalizability of remnant ACL tissue single cell transcriptomes. A) UMAP of Garcia et al. and
Yang et al. integrated dataset with all cells. Color indicates cell type. B) UMAP of all cells split by dataset.
C) Expression of gene markers show on the integrated UMAP, split by dataset. D) UMAP of Garcia et al.
and Yang et al. integrated fibroblast populations only. Cells colored by subpopulation. E) UMAP of
fibroblasts populations split by dataset. F) Expression of gene markers show on the integrated fibroblast
UMAP, split by dataset.
